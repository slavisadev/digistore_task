# Hey there!

Thanks for tanking the time 🙏

Please don't create a Pull Request to the original repository. This is just a dummy project, which is used to demonstrate knowledge of Angular and frontend development in general. It serves as an exercise for candidates to show their skills and knowledge.

I'm eager to learn. Your feedback is highly appreciated.
