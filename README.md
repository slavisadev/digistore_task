## Step 1: Modularization and Separation of Concerns

The initial step of the refactoring process is to modularize the code by separating individual responsibilities into distinct files. This involves:

### Service Extraction
- Moving the `MessageService` into its own dedicated file (`message.service.ts`) within a `services` directory. This ensures that business logic and data management related to messages are encapsulated within a service, adhering to the single-responsibility principle.

### Component Decomposition
- Creating separate files for each Angular component (`MessageComponent`, `ChatComponent`, `CreateMessageComponent`). Each component file contains only the relevant logic, template, and styles for that specific component, promoting better modularity and easier testing.

### File and Folder Structure
- Organizing files into `components` and `services` directories to logically group related parts of the application, improving project structure and navigation.
